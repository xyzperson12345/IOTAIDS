Simple Explanation of Code and Working:

LED Connections:

Green LED (l3) → Pin 4

Yellow LED (l2) → Pin 5

Red LED (l1) → Pin 6

All LED negative legs → resistor → GND



---

What the Code Does (Step-by-Step):

1. Setup:

Sets pin 4, 5, and 6 as outputs (for LEDs).



2. Loop:

Calls the changeLights() function again and again.



3. Inside changeLights() function:

A loop runs from i = 0 to 300 in steps of 20.

Based on the value of i, it controls which LED blinks.



4. LED Behavior Based on i:

i = 0 to 100:

Green LED blinks (ON 0.5s, OFF 0.5s)

Yellow and Red stay OFF


i = 101 to 199:

Yellow LED blinks

Green and Red OFF


i = 200 to 300:

Red LED blinks

Green and Yellow OFF




5. After this sequence, it repeats.

Summary (Very Simple):
Green blinks first → Then Yellow blinks → Then Red blinks → Repeats like traffic signals.

Would you like me to draw a diagram of this traffic light flow?
