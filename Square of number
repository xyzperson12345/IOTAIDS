Explanation (Simple Practical)

Connections:

No external components needed.

Just connect the Arduino to your PC using a USB cable.

Open Serial Monitor from Arduino IDE.



---

Working:

1. Serial.begin(9600):

Starts communication with your PC.



2. Serial.println("Enter the number..."):

Shows a message asking for a number in the Serial Monitor.



3. User Input:

You type a number (like 5) in the Serial Monitor and press Enter.



4. Arduino reads number:

Serial.parseInt() takes the number you typed.



5. Square Calculation:

Arduino multiplies the number with itself.



6. Result:

It shows the square (e.g., 25) in the Serial Monitor.



7. Repeats:

You can keep entering numbers, and it keeps showing squares.
