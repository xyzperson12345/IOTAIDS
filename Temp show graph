Explanation (Simple Practical):

1. LM35 Sensor:

LM35 gives analog output proportional to the temperature.

For every 1°C, it gives 10 mV.



2. Arduino Reads Temperature:

analogRead(A4) reads the voltage from the LM35.

It returns a value between 0 and 1023, corresponding to 0 to 5V.



3. Formula:

The formula used to calculate temperature from the analog value is:

temp = (5.00 * analogRead(A4) * 100) / 1024.0;

5.00 corresponds to the 5V reference voltage.

100 converts the mV to degrees Celsius (since 1°C = 10mV).

1024.0 is the ADC resolution (1024 steps for 10-bit ADC).



4. Output:

It prints the temperature value in Celsius to the Serial Monitor every 1 second.

Note:

You have a small error in the code, as you are reading from A4 (incorrect pin), but you mentioned using A0 for the LM35 in your connections. Update it to:


temp = (5.00 * analogRead(A0) * 100) / 1024.0;

This will ensure the correct pin is read for temperature data.
